# Appwrite RFC's

Architectural and new features proposals and designs for Appwrite.

This repository serves as a central hub to keep track of all major features that go into appwrite and enforces appwrite's principle of transparency.

We want to ensure that any major feature or architectural change is subjected to scrutiny by the community and each change has a good reason to exist and adds value to the project.

## The RFC Process

1. Clone the repository 
2. Create a copy of `rfc-template.md` under `problem/rfc-<your-awesome-idea>.md`. 
3. Fill up [Step 1](rfc-template.md#problem-statement) and raise a PR for the community to review. This will help us understand if the feature/change is worth pursuing. 
4. You will receive feedback on your proposal and once all the comments are addressed, your PR will be marked as `Ready for Design Proposal` or `Changes Proposed` or `Rejected`. 
5. Once marked with `Ready for Design Proposal`, fill up [Step 2](rfc-template.md#design-proposal) of the RFC and move the file over to `design/rfc-<your-awesome-idea>.md` and update the PR. 
6. After another round of reviews, your PR will be marked as `Accepted` or `Changes Requested`.
7. If `Accepted`, Congratulations!! You can go ahead with the implementation of your great new idea!
